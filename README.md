# Foundations-of-Development
This course is an introduction to core technologies used in software development on the Windows and Linux platforms. At the completion of this course, you will be able to manage your local development environment and use GIT to collaborate with other developers.  You will be able to compare virtualization to containerization and use Docker on your local machine to operate a Windows Server and a Linux Server through the command line.  You will also be able to explain the purpose of version control and how to use GIT through the command line to manage source code and collaborate with other developers.

##
The major project for this course is to use GIT and GitHub to collaborate within a team of two or three people.  Your team needs  to create reference guides, blog post(s), and a tutorial(s) on the technologies used in this course.  You need to publish each of these to the web using Github and use the Markdown syntax to write your content.  You should include screenshots within your work and provide links to resources that you use and/or think the reader will find useful. 

### Teams of 2 should complete:  

A reference guide that demonstrates at least 10 commands used to work with GIT, Docker, PowerShell, and Bash respectively.*  
A blog post that compares containerization with virtualization and explains the pros and cons of each.  
A step-by-step tutorial on how to use GitFlow process with GIT and Github to collaborate.

* You can show variations of the same command.

### Teams with 3 members should add:

A step-by-step tutorial on how to use Vim to create and edit files from the Linux command line
A reference guide for Vim at least 10 commands
A step by step tutorial on creating and sharing a Docker repository using Windows 10 and Docker desktop

### Requirements:

* Tasks must be broken down into units of work and assigned to individual team members
* You should use a fork of the main repository maintained by your team leader
* Each task should be completed in a branch and a pull request submitted to the main repositor to have your work merged to the main     repository
* Commit messages should be labeled as task, feature, or fix. 
*Each team member should have at least 10 commits
* You need to have a development branch for in-process work
* You need to have a master branch for the current production release of your content
* Your content should begin with a README.MD file in your GIT repository that provides an index of links to your content 
* Your README.MD should list the contributors to the project 

## Submission Requirements

Each team member submits a link to their own fork and a link to your team's main GitHub repository
